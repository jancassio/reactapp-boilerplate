# Styles

This is the root path for CSS files, the [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) is already configured and is the preferred option to keep your project organized, anyway if your prefer plain CSS you can use too.

For each `*.scss` you create, add a `_` (underscore) char at the beginning of the file name, this means you don't want to generate this file in output process, only the first css file is enough for the most of cases.
