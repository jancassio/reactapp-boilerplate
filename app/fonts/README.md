# Fonts

Put your fonts in this folder, the webpack will resolve all local fonts automatically.

To use that, you can use the same approach of assets, add your fonts at `index.js` to export that,
after then, import those fonts in `app.jsx` for example and the fonts will be available for entire
application.
